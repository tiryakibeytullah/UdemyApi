# UdemyApi
An Api project similar to the Udemy platform was written and presented to the visual with .Net Core Identity.

## Development server

# API Project

At first, you can enter the database address of the project in your database by typing your SqlConnection connection from the appsettings.json file from the .API layer from the 'UdemyNLayer_Project' project. Afterwards, I recommend you to create a migration from the .Data layer. For this, you can create a migration from the Package Manager Console area and update your database.

You can then run the project manually or automatically from the .API Layer and upgrade the Api.

# WEB Project

You can apply the same appsetting.json operations that I have explained above in the 'IdentityUser2' project and ensure that the databases are shared. Finally, after you complete the migration, you can remove the project and use it easily.
